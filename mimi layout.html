			<p style="text-align: justify;margin: 2px; padding:10px;">When I was a kid I wanna be a princess not a queen or the cinderella. But here I am, people call me mimi and I was 20 years old soon i will be 21 years old. So this is my ever last teen. I was grateful that I studies at UiTM Rembau in course Information Management. I never thought that i will get this course since I don't know anything about this course, I don't even choose this course but my cousin did. I learn a lot in college and I receive a lot of love and positive vibes. I knew some were toxic for me but it's okay not everyone like you and not everyone matter. For Sir Kader, first of all i want to say sorry if i did wrong in this coding. It's just so hard for me to learn coding in online. And yet I still trying my best to do this. Sir you did well it's just me don't understand.


			<p style="text-align: justify;margin: 2px; padding:10px;"> Life gotten much harder these day but I will only cheerish the good memories. If sir Kader are reading this, don't worry sir I will try my best to do this coding. Thank you for reading my online distance letter. Be happy and be safe everyone.
